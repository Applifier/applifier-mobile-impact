IMPORTANT NOTE
--------------

2012-11-15: It seems that Apple may be rejecting applications that use the MAC address for advertising tracking purposes.
The current version of the Impact iOS SDK uses the MAC address, and submitting items to the AppStore with the current
is therefore not recommended. We are working hard to provide a version that relies solely on OpenUDID for pre-iOS6
devices, and uses the new identifier for advertising that iOS provides for iOS 6.0+.
